\subsection{Cellular Automata}

A cellular automata is a grid of cells. Each cell can have different states given pre-defined rules. the concept was developped by Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann in the 40's.
The most famous cellular automata, the one that democratize its usage was developp by Conway with the Conway's game of life. In this example, there was a set of 4 different rules that can be found here.
The beautiful thing about it is the complexity that had been created using so simple rules. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Figure below shows some example}}

With the starting configuration \figtonum, we have respectively at generation $87$ and $263$ the two following figures \figtonum.

Programmers, computer scientists and mathematicians then start to make a census of all species they enconter.

In our case, cellular automata is a computational tool for simulating phenomenon. Application were found in various domain from physics to biology. Lattice Gaz Cellular Automata (LGCA) for instance are used to simulate gaz fluid flows, it is the precursor of the lattice Boltzman Method (LBM)\cite{chen_1998}
