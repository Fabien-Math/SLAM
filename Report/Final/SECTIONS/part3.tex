\subsection{Finding the shorthest path distance}
To find the shortest path, I like to take inspiration from nature by simulating a wave propagating through a medium. This way, the shortest path naturally emerges as the one the wave follows.  

The wave equation describes how information spreads at a certain speed, but challenges ariseâ€”how to model refraction, how to ensure the wave propagates at a constant speed. To tackle this, I used a cellular automaton once again. Made for propagating information, they are an interesting tool for this approach.\cite{tapia_2016}

Differently from the part \figtonum, I will use cellular automata as a computational tool for simulating phenomenon. Application were found in various domain from physics to biology. Lattice Gaz Cellular Automata (LGCA) for instance are used to simulate gaz fluid flows, it is the precursor of the lattice Boltzman Method (LBM)\cite{chen_1998}

Base on the work of \textit{Calvo Tavia} and \textit{al}, the implementation process is given by :
