	I would like to take this opportunity in this final project report to express my deep gratitude to all my professors who have supported and guided me throughout my journey.

	I would also like to thank Mr. Frédéric Golay and Mr. Cédric Galusinsky, the two course directors of the MOCA program, for the quality of their teaching, their expertise, and their valuable advice over the past two years.
	
	\vspace{1em}

	Finally, I am especially grateful to Mr. Mehmet Ersoy, who has always been present and available to assist me with all the projects I have undertaken during these three years at SeaTech. Whether it was for HydroSharks, my personal research, my student projects, or soon for my PhD, his support has been invaluable.
