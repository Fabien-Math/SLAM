      abstract = { The equations of motion, boundary conditions and stress-strain relations for a highly elastic material can be expressed in terms of the stored-energy function. This has been done in part I of this series (Rivlin 1948 a), for both the cases of compressible and incompressible materials, following the methods given by E. \&amp; F. Cosserat for compressible materials. The stored-energy function may be defined for a particular material in terms of the invariants of strain. The form in which the equations of motion, etc., are deduced, in the previous paper, does not permit the evaluation of the forces necessary to produce a specified deformation unless the actual expression for the stored-energy function in terms of the scalar invariants of the strain is introduced. In the present paper, the equations are transformed into forms more suitable for carrying out such an explicit evaluation. As examples, the surface forces necessary to produce simple shear in a cuboid of either compressible or incompressible material and those required to produce simple torsion in a right-circular cylinder of incompressible material are derived.}

abstract = {Aconstitutive model is proposed for the deformation of rubber materials which is shown to represent successfully the response of these materials in uniaxial extension, biaxial extension, uniaxial compression, plane strain compression and pure shear. The developed constitutive relation is based on an eight chain representation of the underlying macromolecular network structure of the rubber and the non-Gaussian behavior of the individual chains in the proposed network. The eight chain model accurately captures the cooperative nature of network deformation while requiring only two material parameters, an initial modulus and a limiting chain extensibility. Since these two parameters are mechanistically linked to the physics of molecular chain orientation involved in the deformation of rubber, the proposed model represents a simple and accurate constitutive model of rubber deformation. The chain extension in this network model reduces to a function of the root-mean-square of the principal applied stretches as a result of effectively sampling eight orientations of principal stretch space. The results of the proposed eight chain model as well as those of several prominent models are compared with experimental data of Treloar (1944, Trans. Faraday Soc. 40, 59) illustrating the superiority, simplicity and predictive ability of the proposed model. Additionally, a new set of experiments which captures the state of deformation dependence of rubber is described and conducted on three rubber materials. The eight chain model is found to model and predict accurately the behavior of the three tested materials further confirming its superiority and effectiveness over earlier models.}

Object-orientation techniques enable the creation of data types that closely mimic those of continuum mechanics, and the operator overloading possible in C++ allows normal mathematical symbols to be used for the basic operations. As an example, the implementation of various types of turbulence modeling in a FOAM computational-fluid-dynamics code is discussed, and calculations performed on a standard test case, that of flow around a square prism, are presented. To demonstrate the flexibility of the FOAM library, codes for solving structures and magnetohydrodynamics are also presented with appropriate test case results given. © 1998 American Institute of Physics. }",

Recently, we proposed a strain energy function which is a cubic in I1. Conceptually, the proposed function is a material model with a shear modulus that varies with deformation.

    abstract = { Many attempts have been made to reproduce theoretically the stress–strain curves obtained from experiments on the isothermal deformation of highly elastic ‘rubberlike' materials. The existence of a strain-energy function has usually been postulated, and the simplifications appropriate to the assumptions of isotropy and incompressibility have been exploited. However, the usual practice of writing the strain energy as a function of two independent strain invariants has, in general, the effect of complicating the associated mathematical analysis (this is particularly evident in relation to the calculation of instantaneous moduli of elasticity) and, consequently, the basic elegance and simplicity of isotropic elasticity is sacrificed. Furthermore, recently proposed special forms of the strain-energy function are rather complicated functions of two invariants. The purpose of this paper is, while making full use of the inherent simplicity of isotropic elasticity, to construct a strain-energy function which: (i) provides an adequate representation of the mechanical response of rubberlike solids, and (ii) is simple enough to be amenable to mathematical analysis. A strain-energy function which is a linear combination of strain invariants defined by ϕ(α) = (a1α+a2α+a3α–3)/α is proposed; and the principal stretches a1, a2 and a3 are used as independent variables subject to the incompressibility constraint a1a2 a3 = 1. Principal axes techniques are used where appropriate. An excellent agreement between this theory and the experimental data from simple tension, pure shear and equibiaxial tension tests is demonstrated. It is also shown that the present theory has certain repercussions in respect of the constitutive inequality proposed by Hill (1968a, 1970b). }
