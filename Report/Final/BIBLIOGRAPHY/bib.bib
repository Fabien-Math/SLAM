abstract = {The high-precision localization module is an essential component of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), providing critical parameter information for motion control, decision-making, and environmental sensing. To efficiently recognize the environment and give accurate location and scene information for vehicle motion, the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach is employed for underwater visual applications. Robust visual-based localization and mapping algorithms have generated a lot of interest recently because of the harsh and unpredictable underwater environment. This paper provides an extensive overview of the latest developments in underwater SLAM technology based on optical vision. Special emphasis is placed on different underwater image processing, sensor parameter calibration, odometry, state estimation, loop closure, and mapping methods. Biomimetic SLAM, active SLAM, cooperative SLAM, multi-session SLAM, and other new visual-based types of underwater SLAM are described, along with techniques for multi-sensor fusion. In addition, the paper provides an introduction to ground truth and dataset collection methods for visual underwater SLAM, as well as insightful observations and inspiring future research prospects.}
